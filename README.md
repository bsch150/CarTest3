###Scuttling Steel
This project started as a rough game demo to be used as a proposal for our Advanced Game Development class. However, we are planning on continuing development on this project and are excited to see what it can become and what we can learn from the process!

Currently all development is being done in Unity with the modeling being completed in Blender. To get the prototype off the ground quickly we spliced together different aspects of the Unity Standard Assets and modified/supplemented with our own code as necessary. 

####Mechanics
Generally the goal of this game is to be a fast paced, chaotic, platforming multiplayer racer which an underlying principle of goofiness. Players have full control of their car on the ground as well as control over all rotation in the air. This keeps the game exciting and interesting whether you are gaining on your opponents in a straight away or shooting past them through a jump. Continuing this idea, there is also a boost mechanic which allows players to do many neat tricks such as redirecting themselves mid-air. 

####Art Direction
Scuttling Steel employs a low-poly art style that is full of colors. This style helps bolster the goofy yet exciting gameplay.
